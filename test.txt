\begin{abstract}
Kant insists that the use of concepts must be subject to empirical conditions if they are to have objective validity. This article analyses Kant's principle of objective validity, focusing particularly on its application to transcendental concepts such as those of sensibility, understanding and transcendental apperception. It distinguishes between two orders of objective validity, based on Kant's distinction between empirical and transcendental truths. Since transcendental concepts are pure concepts without spatio-temporal content, their objective validity is of the same second-order kind as that of unschematized categories. This characteristic of transcendental concepts implies that the cognitive powers picked out by them are not particular psychological mechanisms, but rather abstract functional structures. Transcendental concepts owe their objective validity to the realizability of the functional structures by empirical cognizers like humans. This relation in turn helps to explain the nature of transcendental truths.

\section{Introduction}
Kant maintains the principle that a concept has objective validity only if it is related to empirical intuitions. I shall call this the principle of objective validity. There is little doubt that the principle plays a crucial role in Kant's epistemology and his critique of traditional metaphysics, but it is unclear what 'objective validity' means and in what ways concepts acquire objective validity by being related to empirical intuitions. Nor is it clear what the relation is. Some interpretations of the principle may undermine the very possibility of Kant's project. Kant attempts to answer epistemological and metaphysical questions by investigating the faculty of cognition. His theory employs a set of theoretical concepts such as sensibility, understanding and transcendental apperception that describe the necessary functions of cognition; I shall refer to those theoretical concepts that describe the faculty of cognition as transcendental concepts. Since these are not concepts of objects that can be given in intuition, there is a problem of how the transcendental concepts themselves can acquire objective validity.

This article aims to clarify Kant's principle of objective validity and to explain in what sense transcendental concepts can have objective validity. It begins by discussing a verificationist interpretation inaugurated by Peter Strawson (1966) and Jonathan Bennett (1966, 1974). Their verificationist interpretation, despite considerable textual support (A239/B298, A262/B318, A289/B346),\footnote{Add footnotes here as needed.} is widely rejected in more recent Kantian literature (Allison 1983: 61; Bird 2006: 15, 346; Greenberg 2008: 56; Westphal 2004: 42-4). In order to understand Kant's position, some distinctions have to be made. Kant's theory distinguishes between two levels of conceptual content which can be called those of the logical/analytic and the real/objective significance of concepts. It is the latter that matters, and there are two different ways a concept can acquire objective significance and validity: either it is related to empirical intuitions by virtue of its applicability to objects or, in the case of certain pure concepts, it belongs to the conditions that first make the general relation of concepts to empirical objects possible. These two ways of acquiring objective validity roughly correspond to Robert Hanna's distinction between primary and secondary objective validity (2001:91), but I shall draw the distinction somewhat differently, referring to them as first-order and second-order objective validity. I shall explain in what sense second-order objective validity can be ascribed to transcendental concepts and argue that the key feature of transcendental concepts is the absence of spatio-temporal and causal content. Accordingly, sensibility, understanding and transcendental apperception do not describe anything in spatio-temporal reality, nor any cognitive mechanisms of the human mind; instead they are only theoretical constructs representing abstract functions. These functions are to be realized empirically by concrete cognizers such as humans, and it is the possibility of an empirical realization that confers second-order objective validity on transcendental concepts by making them indirectly related to empirical objects. This structure helps to explain in what sense transcendental truths are said to make empirical truths possible.

\section{A Verificationist Interpretation}
Let us begin with the key passage in which Kant puts forward the principle of objective validity:

\textit{all concepts and with them all principles, however a priori they may be, are nevertheless related to empirical intuitions, i.e., to data for possible experience. Without this they have no objective validity at all, but are rather a mere play, whether it be with representations of the imagination or of the understanding. (A239/B298)}

\section{Dialectic could have been much shorter}

Dialectic could have been much shorter, even if Kant still had other problems to deal with in the Dialectic. More problematic is the fact that the verificationist interpretation would affect the very theoretical foundation on which Kant develops his epistemology, and this is the main problem that I address in this article. How can those transcendental concepts such as sensibility, understanding and transcendental apperception acquire objective validity? They are supposed to be conditions that make experience possible, but are themselves neither part of the empirical world nor experienceable through sensible intuitions. How can a theory that is built around these transcendental concepts be objectively valid and true? The verificationist interpretation, if correct, would not only eliminate the metaphysical theory of transcendental idealism, but also undermine the very foundation on which Kant's epistemology, including the principle of objective validity itself, is based.

\section{Logical/Analytic versus Real/Objective Significance}

Despite his rationalist commitment to the existence of pure concepts, Kant is aware of the risk that the content of pure concepts may be a mere construction:

\textit{For every concept there is requisite, first, the logical form of a concept (of thinking) in general, and then, second, the possibility of giving it an object to which it is to be related. Without this latter it has no sense, and is entirely empty of content, even though it may still contain the logical function for making a concept out of whatever sort of data there are. (A239/B298; cf. A262/B318, A289/B346)}

In claiming that a concept without the possibility of being given an object ‘has no sense, and is entirely empty of content', the above passage seems to provide a stronger support for the verificationist interpretation. However, lacking objective validity and having no sense do not mean the same thing; concepts without objective validity are not literally empty of content. A more precise differentiation can show where the verificationist interpretation went wrong. To begin, Kant distinguishes between concepts of understanding and concepts of reason. The latter are Ideas, which would straightforwardly be empty of content according to the verificationist interpretation. But if all Ideas were literally empty, we would be unable not only to know anything about their objects, but even to make meaningful statements about them. Moreover, the pure categories would also be empty of content until they were schematized. Kant has indeed suggested that, when abstracted from their sensible conditions, the pure categories would 'lose all meaning' and become 'empty titles for concepts without any content' (A679/B707), but how could the categories be distinguished from each other if they were literally empty?

A distinction between different senses of ‘content' has to be made. The categories of substance and causality, for example, would be left with 'the logical representation of the subject' (A242/B300) and the representation of 'something that allows an inference to the existence of something else' (A243/B301), respectively, which would specify the logical content of the unschematized categories, i.e. content analytically contained in the concepts. In order to become applicable to the empirical world, the categories need to be further determined in a way that makes their content homogeneous to what can be given in sensibility. In other words, they need to have a content that objects given in intuition could possibly satisfy so as to fall under them. The schematization thus enriches the pure categories with temporal determinations, making them appropriate for empirical employment.

For Kant, schematization does not just add further determinations to the pure categories, simply making them more specific, but rather transforms the pure logical content into appropriate temporal relations. It may appear that the unschematized category of cause, for example, is applicable to every empirical object to which the schematized category of cause is applicable, since the latter seems to pick out a subset of things that are picked out by the former, just as the concept of animal is applicable to everything to which the concept of mammal is applicable. However, schemata do not just represent a further specification of pure categories. Instead, schematization gives a definite temporal interpretation to the pure categories, which would otherwise remain indeterminate as to how they are to be applied to temporal appearances. Without schematization, it is indeterminate whether it is, for instance, the pure concept of cause or that of effect that is applicable in an empirical situation. As Kant explains:

\textit{in that case [i.e. in the case of the concept of a cause as a pure category] not only would there be nothing through which cause and effect could be distinguished, but further, since the possibility of drawing this inference also requires conditions about which I would know nothing, the concept would not even have any determination through which to apply to any object. (A243/B301)}

Pure categories do not have content that is appropriate for empirical application; yet they do have 'the logical form of a concept'. Since all concepts are connected with each other in a complicated logical relationship, the logical form of a concept is its specific logical connection with other concepts, which determines the intension of the concept. This can be called the analytic or logical significance of the concept in contrast to its objective or real significance in the sense of empirical applicability. The logical significance of a concept amounts to the content after abstraction from all sensible content.

Theoretically, it is possible to arbitrarily invent or construct any concept independently of all sensible conditions. An arbitrary concept has its specific logical significance and can be defined precisely (Jäsche Logic, 9: 141-2; Blomberg Logic, 24: 268-9), but this intensional content alone does not guarantee empirical applicability. Surely, pure categories are not just arbitrarily constructed concepts, but their object-relatedness has to be provided by sensible intuitions. Now ‘if one removes this [sensible] condition, all significance, i.e., relation to the object [my italics], disappears' (A241/B300). What is absent in a concept lacking objective validity is the relation to objects. Any arbitrarily constructed, logically meaningful concept has its objects in the logical, thin sense, but whether it can possibly be applied to an object in the real, thick sense is what the principle of objective validity is about.

Kant's principle does not deprive empirically unrelated concepts of logical or intensional content, but only of their real significance in the sense of object-relatedness, leaving them extensionally empty. Empirical concepts can happen to have empty extension, as in the case of a unicorn, but concepts without objective validity are extensionally empty on principle. Put in metaphysical terms, there exists nothing that could possibly fall under any concept lacking objective validity. This may sound a rather strong metaphysical thesis, but as I have argued elsewhere (Lau 2010: 125-33) it follows logically from Kant's theory of categories and the synthetic principles of pure understanding. According to the Second Postulate of Empirical Thinking, the category of existence or actuality is only applicable to something 'which is connected with the material conditions of experience (of sensation)' (A218/B266). Thus only things that are subject to the sensible, spatio-temporal conditions of experience can be said to exist, and this rules out the existence of non-spatio-temporal objects such as abstract entities. All objects in the real, thick sense exist in the spatio-temporal realm.


\section{Empirical versus Transcendental Truth}

Kant's concept of objective validity is subtly connected with his concept of truth, and the connection offers a way to account for the objective validity of transcendental concepts. Although Kant did not distinguish between different senses or orders of objective validity, he did distinguish between empirical and transcendental truth, and, along with it, between empirical and transcendental cognition. According to Kant's correspondence theory, the truth of an empirical cognition consists in 'the agreement of [the] cognition with its object' (A58/B82). The agreement with objects is a specific kind of relation to objects, and empirical truths depend on the object-relatedness of concepts involved in the cognition. This object-relation is something that Kant has to account for in his theory of cognition. If his theory is to be successful, it must contain a great deal of true descriptions about the conditions of cognition. This kind of truth, if any, cannot again be empirical, but must be of another kind, to which Kant refers as transcendental truth:

\textit{All of our cognitions, however, lie in the entirety of all possible experience, and transcendental truth, which precedes all}

\section*{Abstract}

This article explores Kant's concept of objective validity, particularly focusing on the distinction between the first-order objective validity possessed by representations that directly apply to objects of possible experience and the second-order objective validity of transcendental concepts. The author argues that Kant's transcendental idealism can be reconciled with the functionalist interpretation of cognition, while maintaining the objective validity of metaphysical concepts.

\section{Introduction}

(1990: 39-42). Hanna distinguishes between thin and thick meaningfulness (1993: 19).
Young traces the difference back to the distinction between intellectual and figurative
synthesis (1994: 355-7).

\section{Kant's concept of objective validity}

11 In Kant's words, ‘even after abstraction from all sensible condition, significance, but
only a logical significance [my italics] of the mere unity of representations, is left to the
pure concepts of the understanding, but no object and thus no significance is given to
them that could yield a concept of the object' (A147/B186).

12 Kant ascribes ‘transcendental significance' to the 'pure categories, without formal
conditions of sensibility' (A248/B305). The transcendental deduction of categories aims
exactly to show the objective validity of categories, prior to their schematization.

13 Even according to Hanna's own formulation, the schemata and the principles should
have primary, instead of secondary, objective validity: 'Some representations are
objectively valid [POV] because they apply directly to objects of possible experience; but
other representations, despite the fact that they do not apply directly to objects of
possible experience, are nevertheless objectively valid [SOV] because they express
formal transcendental conditions for the direct applicability of representations to objects
of possible experience' (2001: 91-2).

14 If one identifies Kant's faculty of cognition with the human cognitive apparatus, which
executes its function in spatio-temporal reality, then one cannot consistently accept
Kant's metaphysical thesis that spatio-temporal reality depends on our faculty of
cognition. For this reason, functionalist interpreters such as Patricia Kitcher have no
choice but to reject Kant's thesis of the ideality of time (Kitcher 1990: 140-1). I have
argued against the psychological interpretation in another paper (Lau 2014: 384-8).

15 As Kant explains, 'if I leave out all intuition, then there still remains the form of
thinking, i.e., the way of determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition.
Hence to this extent the categories extend further than sensible intuition' (A253-4/B309).

16 The charge of psychologism has a long history that can at least be traced back to Jacob
Friedrich Fries (1828: 29). There are different forms of psychologism, and if one failed to
distinguish the abstract functional requirements from their concrete realizations in
humans and thus mistook Kant's faculty of cognition for the human cognitive system, it
would hardly be avoidable to conclude, with Kitcher, that ‘Kant's epistemology is clearly
weakly psychologistic' (Kitcher 1990: 9).

17 Hanna makes an important contribution in spelling out the difference between the two
different kinds of objective validity (2001: 92-5), but as far as I can see, his detailed
analysis has not drawn much attention among Kant scholars.

18 The notion of second-order objective validity also explains why Kant cannot simply discard
all metaphysical discussion based on a verificationist principle of significance. Since pure
concepts may have second-order objective validity, there is a question concerning whether
metaphysical concepts such as the ideas of soul, world and God might enjoy objective
validity and significance via the non-empirical route. It has to be clarified whether or not
metaphysical concepts belong to the necessary conditions of objective cognition and may
lead to transcendental truths. This can be most clearly seen in the Paralogisms: although the
Transcendental Deduction relies on the transcendental apperception of ‘I think', which
constitutes a logical unity of representations and must be empirically realized by
psychological processes that constitute empirical apperception as the consciousness of
one's identity over time, the second-order objective validity of this transcendental concept
does not apply to the metaphysical concept of the thinking substance. The Paralogisms
show what logical mistakes the doctrine of rational psychology has made in its inference
from the pure 'I think' to the existence of a thinking substance, and in general, the Dialectic
has the task of explaining in details why metaphysical concepts do not have the

\section{Conclusion}
19 second-order objective validity possessed by transcendental concepts such as those of
sensibility, understanding and transcendental apperception.

20 Transcendental truths are not necessary in the sense of being true in all possible worlds;
instead they are true only in those possible worlds in which experience is possible. We
may follow Paul Guyer in calling the kind of necessity at which Kant's transcendental
truths aim a conditional, relative or hypothetical necessity instead of an unconditional
and absolute one (1987: 54-7, 121-4).
